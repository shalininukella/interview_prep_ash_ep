#### Solution

Count new segments.\
Mind that the valid intersecting condition here is <= not < !

```python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        points.sort()
        prev_end = float("-inf")
        new_segment = 0
        for start, end in points:
            if start <= prev_end:
                if end < prev_end:
                    prev_end = end
            else:
                new_segment += 1
                prev_end = end
        
        return new_segment
```

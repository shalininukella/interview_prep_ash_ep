# 1094. Car Pooling

#### Question Link

#### Solution

We need to find the total weight of the intersected sections and compare it with capacity.\
\
We need to keep all previous seen weights in a queue and whenever a new segment is starting we will pop all of the weights that belonged to previous segment and add them up.

```python
class Solution:
    def carPooling(self, trips: List[List[int]], capacity: int) -> bool:
        trips.sort(key=lambda k: (k[1], k[2]))
        car_capacity = 0
        passengers_q = []
        for num_passengers, start, end in trips:
            while passengers_q:
                prev_end, prev_capacity = passengers_q[0]
                if start < prev_end:
                    # all before this are still part of ongoing segment
                    break
                else:
                    car_capacity -= prev_capacity
                    heappop(passengers_q)

            car_capacity += num_passengers
            heappush(passengers_q, (end, num_passengers))
            if car_capacity > capacity:
                return False

        return True
```

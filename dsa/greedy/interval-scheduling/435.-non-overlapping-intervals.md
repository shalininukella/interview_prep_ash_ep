#### Solution

Just count number of overlapping intervals.

```python
class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        intervals.sort()
        prev_start, prev_end = float("-inf"), float("-inf")
        overlapping_segments = 0
        for start, end in intervals:
            if start < prev_end:
                overlapping_segments += 1
                if end < prev_end:
                    prev_end = end
            else:
                prev_end = end
        return overlapping_segments
```

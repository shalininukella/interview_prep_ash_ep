#### Solution

Greedily collect as many words as you can in a line then construct that line accordingly.\
To distribute remaining spaces use round robit from left.

```python
class Solution:
    def construct_line(self, words, max_width):
        letter_count = sum(len(w) for w in words)
        remaining_chars = max_width - letter_count
        required_gaps = len(words) - 1

        if required_gaps == 0:
            return words[0] + " " * remaining_chars

        spaces_per_gap = remaining_chars // required_gaps
        spaces_left_pad = remaining_chars % required_gaps
        
        gaps = [" "*spaces_per_gap] * required_gaps
        i = 0
        gap_index = 0
        while i < spaces_left_pad:
            gaps[gap_index % required_gaps] += " "
            gap_index += 1
            i += 1

        constructed_line = ""
        for i in range(required_gaps):
            constructed_line += words[i] + gaps[i]
        constructed_line += words[i+1]

        return constructed_line
    
    def construct_last_line(self, words, max_width):
        letter_count = sum(len(w) for w in words)
        remaining_chars = max_width - letter_count
        spaces_left_pad = remaining_chars - len(words) + 1
        return " ".join(words) + " "*spaces_left_pad

    def fullJustify(self, words: List[str], maxWidth: int) -> List[str]:
        result = []
        current_line = []
        letter_count = 0
        for word in words:
            is_extra_space_required = bool(current_line)
            existing_spaces = len(current_line) - 1
            if letter_count + len(word) + is_extra_space_required + existing_spaces <= maxWidth:
                current_line.append(word)
                letter_count += len(word)
            else:                
                line = self.construct_line(current_line, maxWidth)
                result.append(line)

                current_line = [word]
                letter_count = len(word)
        
        if current_line:
            line = self.construct_last_line(current_line, maxWidth)
            result.append(line)

        return result
```

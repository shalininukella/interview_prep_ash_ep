#### Solution

To check if course A is dependent on B or not we just need to check if there exists a path between them.\
Because the graph is directed we cant use DSU, we cant use DFS because it will take n^2 time for each query. In worst case the queries can be n^2, so we can precompute all path's existence using floyd warshall.

```python
class Solution:
    def checkIfPrerequisite(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:
        g = [[False]*numCourses for _ in range(numCourses)]
        
        for i in range(numCourses):
            g[i][i] = 0

        for frm, to in prerequisites:
            g[to][frm] = 1
        
        
        for k in range(numCourses):
            for i in range(numCourses):
                for j in range(numCourses):
                    g[i][j] = g[i][j] or (g[i][k] and g[k][j])
        
        result = []
        
        for frm, to in queries:
            result.append(g[to][frm])
        
        return result

```

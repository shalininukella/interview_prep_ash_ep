{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/description/" %}

#### Solution

Find count of cities reachable within threshold for all cities using floyd warshall.

```python
class Solution:
    def findTheCity(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], distanceThreshold: int) -> int:
        g = [[float("+inf")]*n for _ in range(n)]
        
        for frm, to, w in edges:
            g[frm][to] = w
            g[to][frm] = w
        
        for i in range(n):
            g[i][i] = 0

        
        for k in range(n):
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    g[i][j] = min(g[i][j], g[i][k] + g[k][j])
        
        result = 0
        min_city_nbrs = float("+inf")
        for i in range(n):
            city_nbrs = sum(1 for j in range(n) if g[i][j] <= distanceThreshold)
            
            if city_nbrs <= min_city_nbrs:
                result = i
                min_city_nbrs = city_nbrs
        
        return result
```

#### Solution

Its essentially a graph and the edge is representing a relation that is division. Remember that only forward relation is given but backward relation can be derived.\
\
ie. \["a", "b"] = 2 then \["b", "a"] is 1/2

```python
class Solution:
    def calcEquation(self, equations: List[List[str]], values: List[float], queries: List[List[str]]) -> List[float]:
        g = defaultdict(dict)
        
        for (frm, to), v in zip(equations, values):
            g[frm][to] = v
            g[to][frm] = 1/v

        
        result = []
        
        def evaluate(src, dstn):
            if src not in g:
                return -1

            stack = [(src, 1)]
            visited = {src}

            while stack:
                node, cs = stack.pop()
                if node == dstn:
                    return cs

                for nbr, v in g[node].items():
                    if nbr not in visited:
                        visited.add(nbr)
                        stack.append((nbr, v*cs))

            return -1

        for q in queries:
            result.append(evaluate(*q))
        
        return result
```

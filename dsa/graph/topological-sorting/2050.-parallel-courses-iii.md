#### Solution

**Simply taking max at each topo level will not work.**\
Like in this example we can complete 1 then we can start with course 2 we dont need to wait course 4 to finish.

We just need to find the maximum time taken in reaching the "most dependent courses" from "least dependent courses".\
\
Topologically propagate the maximum time a parent node finishes in to it's child node and store the maximum time required to finish processing that child node.\
\
At the end we'll just need to find the maximum of these finish times to get our result.

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, n: int, relations: List[List[int]], time: List[int]) -> int:
        degrees = [0] * n
        dist = [0]*n

        g = defaultdict(list)
        for frm, to in relations:
            g[frm-1].append(to-1)
            degrees[to-1] += 1

        q = deque()    
        for i in range(n):
            if degrees[i] == 0:
                q.append(i)
                dist[i] = time[i]
        
        while q:
            course = q.popleft()

            for nbr in g[course]:
                dist[nbr] = max(dist[nbr], time[nbr] + dist[course])
                degrees[nbr] -= 1
                if degrees[nbr] == 0:
                    q.append(nbr)
        
        return max(dist)

```

#### Solution

The prerequisites form a graph, if its possible to form a valid topological sort it means there are no cyclic dependencies..

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        degrees = [0] * numCourses
        graph = defaultdict(list)

        for frm, to in prerequisites:
            degrees[to] += 1
            graph[frm].append(to)

        q = deque([i for i in range(numCourses) if degrees[i] == 0])

        result_count = 0

        while q:
            node = q.popleft()
            result_count += 1
            for nbr in graph[node]:
                degrees[nbr] -= 1
                if degrees[nbr] == 0:
                    q.append(nbr)

        return result_count == numCourses
```

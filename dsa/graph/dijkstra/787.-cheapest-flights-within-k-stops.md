#### Solution

Its a single source shortest path problem with a constraint that path length cant be greater than k.\
Use Dijkstra to solve.

```python
class Solution:
    def findCheapestPrice(self, n: int, flights: List[List[int]], src: int, dst: int, k: int) -> int:
        g = defaultdict(list)
        
        for source, dstn, cost in flights:
            g[source].append((dstn, cost))
        
        path_lengths = defaultdict(lambda: float("+inf"))

        heap = []
        heappush(heap, (0, src, 0))
        
        while heap:
            cost, node, path_length = heappop(heap)
            if node == dst:
                return cost
            
            if path_length < path_lengths[node] and path_length <= k:
                path_lengths[node] = path_length
                for nbr, to_go_cost in g[node]:
                    heappush(heap, (cost+to_go_cost, nbr, path_length+1))

        return -1
```

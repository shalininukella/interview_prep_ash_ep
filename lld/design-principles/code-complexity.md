# Code Complexity

#### Cyclomatic Complexity



A measure of how risk free and testable the code is.

* Number of linearly independent paths in code.
* Lesser the number of independent paths easier the testability and lesser the chances of breaking a flow.

#### Cognitive Complexity

A measure of how hard to comprehend the code is.

* No universal way to measure it, every tool has their own way of implementing it.
* Usually done by assigning a weight to a programming construct and then taking a weighted sum of different trees.

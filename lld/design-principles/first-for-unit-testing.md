# FIRST for Unit Testing

**Fast**

Should execute fast

**Isolated**

Test should be self contained and defined as `Given`, `When`, `Then` or `Arrange`, `Act`, `Assert`

**Repeatable**

Must be deterministic

**Self Validating**

Shouldn't have to manually check if a test passed or not. Assertions should do the job.

**Thorough**

100% coverage doesn't mean 100% scenarios covered. Focus should be on covering maximum scenarios all the way from sunny day scenarios to edge cases.
